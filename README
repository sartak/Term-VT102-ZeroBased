Term-VT102-ZeroBased 0.82

Term::VT102, a module for terminal emulation, uses 1-based indices for
screen positions. I find this annoying. So this is a simple wrapper around
Term::VT102 that converts 1-based indices to 0-based indices.

Why, in particular, would you want this? Escape sequences use one-based
indices, so it makes perfect sense for Term::VT102 to use one-based
indices. But Curses uses zero-based indices. And so do most other modules.

See Term::VT102 for the documentation on using these modules.
